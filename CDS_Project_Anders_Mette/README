This is the Cultural Data Science exam project for Anders Røn and Mette Hejberg Pedersen

Due to overassigning our script, we felt the need to use two markdowns to make it easier to navigate. Therefore one should open Reproducibility in Second Language 
Research Wrangling 1.Rmd first, then Reproducibility in Second Language Research Wrangling 2.Rmd
